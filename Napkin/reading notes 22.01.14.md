# preface
## philosophy of this book

This book wan't to take a place in the middle ground between a "vague notion" and university learning and researching, and let people adore the beauty of mathematics.

**Natural explanations supersede proofs**

1. precise definitions.
2. acquaint few really major examples.
3. know the precise statements of famous theorems, and having a sense of why they *should* be true.


understading "why" something is true can have many forms:
This is sometimes accomplished with a complete rigorous proof; in other cases, it is given by the idea of the proof; it is just a few key examples with extensive cheerleading.


# Advice for the reader
## Prerequisites

[[数学成熟度 Mathematical maturity]]

1. Readers need to know how to read and write a proof, follow logical arguments, and so on.
2. Readers also need to familiar with basic terminology about sets and functions
(e.g. “what is a bijection?”). If not, one should consult Appendix E.

## Deciding what to read
I suggest that you simply pick a chapter you find interesting, and then find the shortest path.
