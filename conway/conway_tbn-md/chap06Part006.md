# A BABYLONIAN TABLE OF PYTHAGOREAN FRACTIONS

These "Pythagorean fractions" were known long before Pythagoras. Figure
6.10a shows a Babylonian clay tablet that was thought to record some
commercial transactions before Otto Neugebauer pointed out its
connection with Pythagorean triples.

We taught you to read Babylonian cuneiform in Chapter 1, so you'll be
able to check the translation given in Figure 6.10b. The tablet is
obviously broken. There are various speculations as to the exact scope
(and use!) of the original table, but our own reconstruction is given in
Figure 6.11. According to this, the full table could have recorded all
of the shapes

$$\text{length : breadth : diagonal}$$

proportional to

$$2pq:p^2-q^2:p^2+q^2$$

with $p$ and $q$ 'regular' numbers (i.e., that divide powers of $60$)
and $q$ less than $60$.

To close the chapter, we'll show you how to find fractions that are good
approximations to other numbers.

We have a new suggestion for the error on line 2. We think that
$3,12 + 1 (= 193)$ was written in error for $120,25 (= 25 \times 193)$.
We also believe that on line $11,45$ and $1,15$ should be thought of as
$\frac{3}{4}$ and $1\frac{1}{4}$, respectively, since the $3,4,5$ case
was regarded as basic and the length $4$ was taken as the unit.

Other errors are

$$\begin{array}{ll}
        \text{on line 8  } & \text{$59 (= 45 + 14)$ was written in error for $45,14$,}\\
        \text{on line 9  } & \text{$9,1 (= 541)$ was written in error for $8,1 (= 481)$,}\\
        \text{on line 13 } & \text{$7,12,1 (= 1617)$ was written in error for $2,41 (= 161)$,}\\
        \text{on line 15 } & \text{$56$ and $53$ were written in place of $28$ and $53$ (or $56$ and $106$).}\\
    \end{array}$$
