Historically, geometry has often been a source of new numbers (Figure
7.1). Figure 7.1 is our redrawing of tablet number $7289$ in the Yale
Babylonian Collection.

You must be getting quite good at reading Babylonic cuneiform, so you
can probably make out the base 60 numbers on the diagonal of the square
($1 = 1, < = 10$). If we use the notation usually associated with
another bequest of the Babylonians, it is $1^\circ 24'51''10''$, meaning

$$1+\frac{24}{60}+\frac{51}{60^2}+\frac{10}{60^3}=1.414 212 962 962 96...$$

FIGURE 7.1 YBC 7289.

The tablet multiplies this value of $\sqrt{2}$ by the side
($30' = \frac{1}{2}^\circ$) of the square, to obtain its diagonal.

How did the Babylonians find this remarkable approximation? Certainly
not by measuring! If the side of the square is a mile, then, mixing
''metraphors,'' the error in measuring the diagonal would be less than a
millimeter! (When was man first able to measure with this accuracy?
Probably only in this century.) Plainly, they used calculation.

However this value of V2 was calculated, it seems certain that the
Babylonians knew that the calculation was not complete (although it is a
very good place to stop the calculation, because the next sexagesimal
''place'' is quite small).

Does the calculation ever stop? Or become periodic? One of the most
astounding discoveries attributed to Pythagoras implies that both
answers are NO.

FiGuRE 7.2 The Babylonian calculation continued.

The sequence of sexagesimal "digits" in Figure 7.2 should continue
indefinitely, and neither is $\sqrt{2}$ a recurring decimal:

$\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135623 7309504880 1688724209 6980785696... .$

It's surprising that such a deep fact was established so early in human
history.

Actually, we don't really know that it was Pythagoras himself who
discovered this fact, since the Pythagoreans were a mystical brotherhood
who habitually ascribed all their discoveries to the master. (There may
also have been, as we hinted above, some Babylonian influence.) We do
know that the Pythagoreans and the later Greek geometers were tightly
very impressed by it. The standard story related by Proclus is that they
sacrificed a hundred oxen in its honor, The Pythagorean result is

$$\boxed{\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{2}\text{ cannot be expressed}\\
\text{as a fraction b}\\
\text{where } a, b \text{ are whole numbers.}\\
\end{array}}\\
\text{Pythagoras’ Big Theorem}\\
$$

The discussion in Chapter 4 then implies that its decimal expansion does
not terminate or become periodic. The same holds in any other scale of
notation, for example, the Babylonian sexagesimal scale.

In the standard mathematical language we refer to ratios or **rational
numbers**, rather than fractions, and we assert that

$$\sqrt{2} \text{ is an irrational number,}$$

historically the first known example of such a number's existence.

FIGURE 7.3 Unfolding the mystery of V2.

We can see the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ by folding a square of paper
(Figure 7.3)! From Pythagoras's theorem the length of the diagonal is
$\sqrt{2}$ times the length of the side. If the length of the side is
$12$ inches, the length of the diagonal is

$$12\sqrt{2} = 16.97056 ... \text{inches,}$$

or nearly $17$ inches. So $\sqrt{2}$ is very nearly $\frac{17}{12}$.
However, we shall show that $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be equal to any such
fraction. If it *bad* been $\frac{17}{12}$, the diagonal of a $12$-inch
square would be exactly $17$ inches. In Figure 7.3 fold the side $AD$
from its original position $AD’$ onto the diagonal $AC$. Then $CDE$ is
the same shape as $ABC$ (so that $CD = DE$) and still has whole number
sides, namely

$$\begin{array}{ll}
CD = 5, & \text{ obtained as } 17 - 12, \\
CE = 7, & \text{ obtained as } 12 - 5, \\
\end{array}$$

so the simplest fraction for $\sqrt{2}$ couldn't be $\frac{17}{12}$, for
it would already have been $\frac{7}{5}$. The same argument, starting
with a square of diagonal $a$ and side $b$, shows that $\sqrt{2}$ can't
equal any rational number $a/b$ in its lowest terms.

Similar proofs in Figures 7.4 and 7.5 show that the ratios
(diagonal/side) for a regular pentagon and (short diagonal/side) for a
regular hexagon are irrational numbers. In Figure 7.4, $BEA$ is similar
to $ABD$, but $AB = AE = d$ and $BE = c - d$. In Figure 7.5, $CDE$ is
similar to $ABC$, but $CD = DE = e - f$ and $CE = 2f- (e -f) = 3f -e$.

The ratio (diagonal/side) for a regular pentagon is called the **golden
number** $\tau = 1.61803398...$ . Its exact value is $(1 + \sqrt{5})/2$
and its wonderful properties have intrigued many people from Greek times
through today. Fra Luca Pacioli wrote an entire book on the subject,
called De Divina Proportione, printed in 1509. Many people think that
the **golden rectangle**, the ratio of whose sides is the golden number,
is the most aesthetically pleasing.

For the hexagon, the ratio $e/f$ equals $\sqrt{3} = 1.732050807 ...$ in
Figure 7.5. Our geometrical proof that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational can be
generalized arithmetically.

Of course, some square roots of whole numbers are rational. For
instance, $\sqrt{9} = 3$. The correct assertion is that if the square
root of a whole number is not itself a whole number, then it is not a
fraction either. There's an easy arithmetical proof. If $N$ is a whole
number for which $\sqrt{N}$ isn't a whole number, suppose $B/A$ is the
simplest fraction for $\sqrt{N}$, Then $B/A$ wouid also equal $NA/B$.
The fractional parts of $B/A$ and $NA/B$ have the form $a/A$ and $b/B$,
where $a, b$ are positive numbers smaller than $A,B$. But if two numbers
are equal, their fractional parts are also equal:

$$\frac{a}{A}=\frac{b}{B}$$

and so

$$\frac{b}{a}=\frac{B}{A}=\sqrt{N}$$

This gives a simpler form for $\sqrt{N}$, contrary to our assumption.

For instance, if $\sqrt{2}$ were $\frac{17}{12}$ it would also be
$\frac{24}{17}$, and the fractional parts of these would be equal.

$$\frac{5}{12}\text{ would equal  }\frac{7}{17}\text{, and }\frac{7}{5}\text{ would equal }\frac{17}{12}=\sqrt{2},$$

giving a simpler fraction for $\sqrt{2}$.

So if you thought that all numbers were fractions, you were wrong! There
are lots of irrational numbers: indeed, in Chapter 9 we'll see that
there are many, many more irrational numbers than rational ones.
