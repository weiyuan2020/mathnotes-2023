# MILLIONS, BILLIONS, AND OTHER ZILLIONS

The Italians added an augmenting suffix to *mille* (Latin, "thousand")
to obtain *millione* ('great thousand''), now milione, from which we get
our "million." Around 1484, N. Chuquet coined the words *billion,
trillion, ..., nonillion*, which also appeared in print in a 1520 book
by Emile de la Roche. These arithmeticians used "illion" after the
prefixes

b, tr, quadr, quint, sext, sept, oct and non

to denote the

2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th

powers of a million. But around the middle of the 17th century, some
other French arithmeticians used them instead for the

3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th

powers of a thousand.

Although condemned by the greatest lexicographers as "erroneous"
(Littré) and "an entire perversion of the original nomenclature of
Chuquet and de la Roche" (Murray), the newer usage is now standard in
the U.S., although the older one survives in Britian and is still
standard in the continental countries (but the French spelling is
nowadays "llon" rather than "llion").

These huge numbers were once just arithmeticians' playthings, but the
march of science has forced people to find even more names for them.
Here are the number-prefixes recommended by the Conference Générale des
Poids et Mesures in 1991 (the number names are in the American system):

  ----------------- ------- ---------- --------- -------------- --- -------------
  unit $\times$ N           unit / N               the number N     
  deca              (da)    deci       \(a\)               $10$ =   ten
  hecto             \(h\)   centi      \(c\)              $100$ =   hundred
  kilo              \(k\)   milli      \(m\)             $1000$ =   thousand
  mega              \(M\)   micro      ($\mu$)           $10^6$ =   million
  giga              \(G\)   nano       \(n\)             $10^9$ =   billion
  tera              \(T\)   pico       \(p\)          $10^{12}$ =   trillion
  peta              \(P\)   femto      \(f\)          $10^{15}$ =   quadritlion
  exa               \(E\)   atto       \(a\)          $10^{18}$ =   quintillion
  zetta             \(Z\)   zepto      \(z\)          $10^{21}$ =   sextillion
  yotta             \(Y\)   yocto      \(y\)          $10^{24}$ =   geptillion
  ----------------- ------- ---------- --------- -------------- --- -------------

How do the "illion" words continue? We shall use "zillion" for the
typical one of them, so that the N'th zillion is $10^{3N+3}$ (American)
or $10^{6N}$ (British). The first $9$ "zillion" names are Chuquet's
"million", "billion", "trillion", "quadrillion", "quintillion",
"sextillion", "septillion", "octillion", "nonillion", and "centillion"
is already a wellestablished word for the 100th one. You can find a name
for any zillion from the 10th to the 999th by combining parts from the
appropriate columns of the following table, and then replacing the final
vowel by "illion":

  --- ----------- --------- -------------- --------- --------------
      units       $^{}$     tens           $^{}$     hundreds
  1   un          $^{n}$    deci           $^{nx}$   centi
  2   duo         $^{ms}$   viginti        $^{n}$    ducenti
  3   tre(\*)     $^{ns}$   triginta       $^{ns}$   trecenti
  4   quattuor    $^{ns}$   quadraginta    $^{ns}$   quadringenti
  5   quinqua     $^{ns}$   quinguaginta   $^{ns}$   quingenti
  6   se(\*)      $^{n}$    Sexaginta      $^{n}$    sescenti
  7   septe(\*)   $^{n}$    septuaginta    $^{n}$    septingenti
  8   octo        $^{mx}$   actoginta      $^{mx}$   octingenti
  9   nove(\*)    $^{}$     nonaginta      $^{}$     nongenti
  --- ----------- --------- -------------- --------- --------------

$^{*}$Note: when it is immediately before a component marked with $^S$
or $^X$ , "tre" increases to "tres" and "se" to "ses" or "sex" as
appropriate. Similarly "septe" and "nove" increase to "septem" and
"novem" or "septen" and "noven" immediately before components marked
with $^m$ or $^n$.

With Allan Wechsler we propose to extend this system indefinitely [^1]
by combining these according to the convention that "XilliYilliZillion"
(say) denotes the ($1000 000X + 1000Y + Z$)th zillion, using "nillion"
for the zeroth "zillion'? when this is needed as a placeholder. So for
example the million-and-third zillion is a "millinillitrillion."

You can now use the usual rules for combining this complete system of
zillion words (which first appears in the present *Book of Numbers*) so
as to obtain correct 'English names', like

"four millinillitrillion (and) fifteen,"

meaning

$4.10^{3000012} + 15$ (American) or $4.10^{6000018} + 15$ (British),

for all of the integers!

We close with a table of English words for powers of ten.

  ----------------------- ----------------------------------
  ten or decad            $10^{1}$
  hundred or hecatontad   $10^{2}$
  thousand or chiliad     $10^{3}$
  myriad                  $10^{4}$
  lac or lakh             $10^{5}$
  million                 $10^{6}$
  crore                   $10^{7}$
  myriamyriad             $10^{8}$
  milliard                $10^{9}$
  billion                 $10^{9}$ (formerly $10^{12}$)
  trillion                $10^{12}$ (formerly $10^{18}$)
  quadrillion             $10^{15}$ (formerly $10^{24}$)
  decillion               $10^{33}$ (formerly $10^{60}$)
  vigintillion            $10^{63}$ (formerly $10^{120}$)
  centillion              $10^{303}$ (formerly $10^{600}$)
  googol                  $10^{100}$
  googolplex              $10^{googol}$
  Nplex                   $10^{N}$ (Rudy Rucker)
  Nminex                  $10^{-N}$ (Tadashi Tokieda)
  ----------------------- ----------------------------------

We recommend "Nplex" and "Nminex" both as the nouns for those numbers
and as adjectives indicating multiplication by them. So "hundredplex" is
another name for a googol, the mass of the Sun is roughly two 33plex
grams, and an Angstrom unit is a 10minex meter.

Some other cultures have more interesting names for these numbers.
Japanese has individual names for various powers of ten between
$10^{-32}$ and $10^{88}$, many of Indian origin. Some of these are

  --------- ---------------- -----------------------------
  88plex    = muryoutaisuu   "large amount of nothing"
  80plex    = fukashigi      "don't even think about it"
  56plex    = kougasha       "sands of the Ganges"
  16minex   = shunsoku       "breathing instant"
  17minex   = danshi         "finger snapping"
  23minex   = jou            "clean"
  --------- ---------------- -----------------------------

[^1]: Our proposal does have one sad effect. Donald Knuth's number
    "eight billion, eighteen million, eighteen thousand eight hundred
    fifty-seven" is probably no longer the alphabetically earliest prime
    number in the American system.
