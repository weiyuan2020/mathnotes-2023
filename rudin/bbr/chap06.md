# The Riemann-Stieltjes integral {#chap:06}

The present chapter is based on a definition of the Riemann integral
which depends very explicitly on the order structure of the real line.
Accordingly, we begin by discussing integration of real-valued functions
on intervals. Extensions to complex- and vector-valued functions on
intervals follow in later sections. Integration over sets other than
intervals is discussed in Chaps.
