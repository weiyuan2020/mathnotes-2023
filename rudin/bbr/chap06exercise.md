[]{#ex:6.7 label="ex:6.7"} Suppose $f$ is a real function on $(0, 1]$

(and is finite).

(a) If $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[0,1]$, show that this definition of the
    integral agree with the old one.

(b) Construct a function $f$ such that the above limit exists, although

\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \mathrm{d} x = 
        \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x

said to converge .

Assume that $f(x) \geq 0$ and that $f$ decreases monotonically on
$[1, \infty)$. Prove that 
$$
\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \mathrm{d} x

[]{#ex:6.9 label="ex:6.9"} Show that integration by parts can sometimes
be applied to the "improper" integrals defined in Exercises
\[\[ex:6.7\]](#ex:6.7){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:6.7"} and
\[\[ex:6.8\]](#ex:6.8){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:6.8"}. (State
appropriate hypotheses, formulate a theorem, and prove it.) For instance
show that 
$$

        \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{(1+x)^2} \mathrm{d} x .

[]{#ex:6.10 label="ex:6.10"} Let $p$ and $q$ be positive real numbers
such that 
$$
\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1 .

 Prove the following
statements.

If $u \geq 0$ and $v \geq 0$, then

 Equality holds if and only

 then

$$
\int_{a}^{b} fg \mathrm{d} \alpha \leq 1.
$$


if $f$ and $g$ are complex functions in $\mathscr{R}$, then

$$
\left| \int_{a}^{b} fg \mathrm{d} \alpha \right| \leq
            \left\{ \int_{a}^{b} \left| f \right|^p \mathrm{d} \alpha \right\}^{1/p}
