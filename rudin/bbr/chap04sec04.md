# Continuity and connectedness

<!-- ::: thm -->
[]{#thm:4.22 label="thm:4.22"} If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a
metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, and if $E$ is a connected
subset of $X$, then $f(E)$ is connected.

[]{#thm:4.23 label="thm:4.23"} Let $f$ be a continuous real function on
the interval $[a, b]$. If $f(a) <f(b)$ and if $c$ is a number such that
$f(a) < c < f(b)$, then there exists a point $x \in (a, b)$ such that
$f(x) = c$.

[]{#myremark:4.24 label="myremark:4.24"} At first glance, it might seem
that Theorem \[\[thm:4.23\]](#thm:4.23){reference-type="ref"
reference="thm:4.23"} has a converse. That is, one might think that if
for any two points $x_1 < x_2$ and for any number $c$ between $f(x_1)$
and $f(x_2)$ there is a point $x$ in $(x_1 , x_2)$ such that $f(x) = c$,
then $f$ must be continuous.
