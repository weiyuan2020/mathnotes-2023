# Change of variables

We can now describe the effect of a change of variables on a multiple
integral. For simplicity, we confine ourselves here to continuous
functions with compact support, although this is too restrictive for
many applications. This is illustrated by Exercises
\[\[ex:10.9\]](#ex:10.9){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:10.9"} to
\[\[ex:10.13\]](#ex:10.13){reference-type="ref" reference="ex:10.13"}


### thm:10.9 
 Suppose $T$ is a 1-1
$\mathscr{C}'$-mapping of an open set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ such
that $J_T(\mathbf{x}) \neq 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in E$. If $f$ is a
continuous function on $\mathbb{R}^k$ whose support is compact and lies in
$T(E)$, then 
\label{eq:10.31}

$$

        \int_{\mathbb{R}^k} f(\mathbf{y}) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{y} =
        \int_{\mathbb{R}^k} f(T \mathbf{x}) \left| J_T(\mathbf{x}) \right| \mathrm{d} \mathbf{x} .
