# Continuity {#chap:04}

The function concept and some of the related terminology were introduced
in Definitions \[\[mydef:2.1\]](#mydef:2.1){reference-type="ref"
reference="mydef:2.1"} and
\[\[mydef:2.2\]](#mydef:2.2){reference-type="ref" reference="mydef:2.2"}.
Although we shall (in later chapters) be mainly interested in real and
complex functions (i.e., in functions whose values are real or complex
numbers) we shall also discuss vector-valued functions (i.e., functions
with values in $\mathbb{R}^{k}$) and functions with values in an arbitrary
metric space. The theorems we shall discuss in this general setting
would not become any easier if we restricted ourselves to real
functions, for instance, and it actually simplifies and clarifies the
picture to discard unnecessary hypotheses and to state and prove
theorems in an appropriately general context.

The domains of definition of our functions will also be metric spaces,
suitably specialized in various instances.
