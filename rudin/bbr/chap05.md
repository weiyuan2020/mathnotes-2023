# Differentiation {#chap:05}

In this chapter we shall (except in the final section) confine our
attention to *real* functions defined on intervals or segments. This is
not just a matter of convenience, since genuine differences appear when
we pass from real functions to vector-valued ones. Differentiation of
functions defined on $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ will be discussed in Chap.
\[\[chap:09\]](#chap:09){reference-type="ref" reference="chap:09"}.
