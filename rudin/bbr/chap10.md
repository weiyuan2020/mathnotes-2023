# Integration of differential forms {#chap:10}

Integration can be studied on many levels. In Chap.
\[\[chap:06\]](#chap:06){reference-type="ref" reference="chap:06"}, the
theory was developed for reasonably well-behaved functions on
subintervals of the real line. In Chap.
\[\[chap:11\]](#chap:11){reference-type="ref" reference="chap:11"} we
shall encounter a very highly developed theory of integration that can
be applied to much larger classes of functions, whose domains are more
or less arbitrary sets, not necessarily subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. The present
chapter is devoted to those aspects of integration theory that are
closely related to the geometry of euclidean spaces, such as the change
of variables formula, line integrals, and the machinery of differential
forms that is used in the statement and proof of then-dimensional
analogue of the fundamental theorem of calculus, namely .
